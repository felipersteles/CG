# Computer Graphics with WebGL
Using WebGL to learn about graphics computing. This repository serves as a springboard for your journey into the world of computer graphics using WebGL! We'll explore creating shapes, bringing them to life with animation, and even render a classic constellation – all within your web browser.

## Learning WebGL:

There are fantastic resources available to guide you through the exciting world of WebGL. Here are a few recommendations:

* **Websites:**
    * [A WebGL Introduction](https://webglfundamentals.org/) - A comprehensive and well-structured tutorial from Google.
    * WebGL Fundamentals [invalid URL removed] - The official documentation from Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).
* **Books:**
    * " WebGL Programming Guide" by Laurens Cantarelli and Khronos Group ([ISBN 148421009X])
    * " Interactive WebGL: Creating Stunning 3D Graphics for the Web" by Eric Haines ([ISBN 0134645668])


**Project Overview:**

This repository includes a basic WebGL application (`index.html` and `script.js`) that demonstrates:

1. **Drawing Polygons:** We'll create a simple polygon shape using WebGL primitives.
2. **Animation:** We'll implement code to rotate the polygon, creating a sense of movement.
3. **Constellation Rendering:** Explore including a pre-defined set of points and lines to represent a constellation like Orion or Ursa Major.

**Running the Application:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * A modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. **Instructions:**
    * Clone this repository to your local machine.
    * Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Exploring the Code:**

* `index.html`: This file sets up the basic HTML structure and loads the JavaScript code that renders the WebGL scene.
* `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the core functionalities for creating the polygon, animating its rotation, and (optionally) rendering a constellation.

**Challenge Yourself!:**

This is just the beginning! Feel free to experiment and expand on the concepts:

* Try creating different shapes (triangles, squares, etc.).
* Implement different animation effects (scaling, translation).
* Explore lighting and shading techniques for a more realistic feel.
* Add user interaction – allow users to control the rotation or display information on hover.
* Create a library of constellations or even venture into 3D models of celestial bodies!

**Remember:**

* Consistent commenting throughout your code improves readability and maintainability.
* Practice is key! The more you experiment, the more comfortable you'll become with WebGL.
* There's a vast WebGL community online. Don't hesitate to seek help or share your creations!
